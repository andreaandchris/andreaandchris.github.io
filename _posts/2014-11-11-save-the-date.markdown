The catering is booked, the marquee has been chosen, so the date's pretty much set in stone now! Saturday, August the 15th 2015. Put it in your diaries!

Andrea's parents, Helga and Roland, are kindly letting us use their garden for the reception and their neighbour, Chris, just so happens to own a beautiful quarry around the corner, where we'll be holding the ceremony (a big "thank you" to Chris). The house is really close to Inchture, Perthshire. We'll send out full instructions on getting there a bit nearer to the day.

In the meantime, if you want to grab a (relative) bargain, you might want to book transport early. Dundee is very close (a 10 minute taxi ride), you can fly directly, fly to Edinburgh or get the train/ drive all the way. Give one of us a shout if you need help making arrangements. We'll be in touch shortly with some suggestions for accommodation but for those who are feeling adventurous there will be a spot for camping!

Other than that, stay tuned. We'll put updates on this site and put up an RSVP at some point in the near future.

Chris & Andrea
